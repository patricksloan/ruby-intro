# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 3-arrays.rb

# Arrays are lists of things

favorite_foods = ["tacos", "pizza", "ice cream"]
# puts favorite_foods

# we_have_to_go_back = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
# puts we_have_to_go_back

# mixed_array = ["tacos", 12, true]
# puts mixed_array

# Accessing the array

shopping_lists = [["milk", "eggs", "toilet paper"], ["soap", "shampoo", "shaving cream", "toilet paper"]]
# puts shopping_lists

# first_favorite_food = favorite_foods[0]
# puts first_favorite_food

# shopping_lists[1][2]

# second_shopping_list = shopping_lists[1]
# third_item = second_shopping_list[2]
# puts third_item

# Add to the array

favorite_foods.push ("more tacos")
puts favorite_foods

# There are lots of fun things you can do with arrays:

puts favorite_foods.length
puts favorite_foods.count   
puts favorite_foods.size
